Description: 

Monitoring system is basic system used to detect temperature and lighting, if the temperature exceeded a certain degree, alarm system 
will be activated.

We can turn On/Off the alarm system using the push button, If it's on and the temperature is high, the LED starts blinking as well as there
will be a beep till the temperature drops.

For this project you will need:
    1 - Arduino uno
    2 - Breadboard
    3 - LED
    4 - 2x 10 KOhm Resistors
    5 - Push Button
    6 - Buzzer
    7 - 1x Temperature Sensor
    8 - 1x Light Sensor
    9 - 12x Jumper Wires
